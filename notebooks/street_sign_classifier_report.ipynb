    "\n",
    "* [LISA Traffic Sign Dataset](http://cvrr.ucsd.edu/LISA/lisa-traffic-sign-dataset.html) - a set of pictures and videos with annotated frames containing US traffic signs.\n",
    "* [BelgiumTS Dataset](https://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/) - a set of labelled pictures containing Belgium traffic signs.\n",

So instead of using the pre-split data, we merge them back together into a single dataset. We then randomly split this merged dataset into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets."

    "We resized the images to 32x32 pixels. This was done using `scikit-image`. A few different sizes were tested: 16x16, 32x32, and 64x64. We found that 32x32 gave us the same accuracy as 64x64, while being faster to train with. 16x16 was ruled out because the it resulted in the DNN being ~3% less accurate than with 32x32."

    "[This paper](https://btsd.ethz.ch/shareddata/publications/Mathias-IJCNN-2013.pdf) documents the performance of several models on the same BTSC dataset I used. My model is right around the average performance of other models, which is 95-97%. Interestingly, one model in this paper was able to achieve a superhuman performance of 99.46% on the dataset (human performance is 98.84%). However, the paper notes that \"this  quality  improvement  comes  to  the  price  of 37 hours of training on dedicated hardware (using 4 GPUs).\""
